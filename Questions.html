    <h2>Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.</h2>
    <h4 style="color: blue;">
        Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow a program to take different actions based on whether a certain condition (or set of conditions) is true or false. These statements enable decision-making in code, allowing the program to execute certain blocks of code only under specific conditions. They are fundamental in controlling the flow of a program.
<h3>Types of Conditional Statements in JavaScript</h3>
<h4 style="color: rgb(20, 60, 220);">
1. if  :- 
The if statement is the simplest form of conditional statement. It executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
<br>
Syntax:-
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
</div>
<br>
Example:-
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

let age = 20;
<br>
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
</div>
<br>
Explanation:- 
<li>If the age is 18 or greater, the message "You are eligible to vote." is printed.  </li>
<br>
2. if else:- 
The if...else statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
<br>
Syntax:-
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} 
<br>else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
</div>
<br>
Example:-
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

let age = 16;
<br>
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
<br> else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
</div>
<br>
Explanation: 
<li>If age is less than 18, "You are not eligible to vote." is printed. </li>
<br>
3. else if :- 
The else if statement is used to test multiple conditions. If the first condition is false, it checks the next condition, and so on.
<br>
Syntax:-
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} 
<br>else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}
<br> else {
    // Code to be executed if all previous conditions are false
}
</div>
<br>
Example:
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

let temperature = 25;
<br>

if (temperature > 30) {
    console.log("It's hot outside.");
} 
<br>else if (temperature > 20) {
    console.log("It's warm outside.");
} 
<br> else {
    console.log("It's cold outside.");
}
</div>
<br>
Explanation:-
 <li>The program checks if the temperature is above 30, if not, it checks if it is above 20, otherwise, it assumes itâ€™s cold. </li>

<br>
4. switch :- 
The switch statement is another way to handle multiple conditions, particularly when checking a variable against multiple values.
<br>
Syntax:-
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

switch (expression) {
    <br>
    case value1:
        // Code to be executed if expression === value1
        <br>
        break;
        <br>
    case value2:
    <br>
        // Code to be executed if expression === value2
        <br>
        break;
        <br>
    
    default:
    <br>
        // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}

</div>
<br>
Example:-
<br>
<div style="color: rgb(36, 153, 69);">

let day = "Monday";
<br>
switch (day) {
    <br>
    case "Monday":
    <br>
        console.log("Start of the work week.");
        <br>
        break;
        <br>
    case "Friday":
    <br>
        console.log("End of the work week.");
        <br>
        break;
        <br>
    case "Saturday":
    <br>
    case "Sunday":
    <br>
        console.log("It's the weekend!");
        <br>
        break;
        <br>
    default: <br>
        console.log("Midweek day.");
}
</div>
<br>
Explanation: 
<li>The program checks the value of day and prints a message based on whether it is Monday, Friday, or a weekend day. </li>

    <h4 style="color: blue;">
        Code:-

        Explaination:- 
        <li>
The function takes marks as an argument and determines the grade based on the conditions provided.
<li>Condition 1: If marks are greater than 90, the grade is "A". </li>
<li>Condition 2: If marks are between 70 and 90 (inclusive of 90), the grade is "B". </li>
<li>Condition 3: If marks are between 50 and 70 (inclusive of 70), the grade is "C". </li>
<li>Condition 4: If marks are below 50, the grade is "F".
        </li>

    <h2>Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
        examples.</h2>
        <h4 style="color: blue;">
            Loops are programming constructs that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential in programming because they enable you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently without writing the same code multiple times. Loops can automate repetitive processes, iterate over data structures, and control the flow of a program.
            <h3>Why Do We Need Loops?
            </h3>
            <div style="color: blue;">
             <li>Efficiency: Loops help avoid redundant code by executing the same code block multiple times.</li> 
             <li>Automation: They allow for automatic repetition of tasks, which is crucial when dealing with large datasets or complex computations</li>
             <li>Dynamic Processing: Loops enable the handling of data dynamically, where the number of iterations may not be known beforehand.</li>

            </div>
<h2>Types of Loops in JavaScript:-
</h2>
<h4 style="color: blue;">
    1. for Loop :- 

The for loop is the most commonly used loop in JavaScript. It is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
<br>
Syntax:
<br>
<div style="color: green;">
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    <br>
    // Code to be executed
}
</div>
Example:
<br>
<div style="color: green;">
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    <br>
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
}
</div>
<br>

2. while Loop:- 

The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. It runs as long as the specified condition is true.
<br>
Syntax:
<div style="color: green;">
while (condition) {
    <br>
    // Code to be executed
}
</div>
Example:
<div style="color: green;">
let i = 0;
<br>

while (i < 5) {
    <br>
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
    <br>
    i++;
}
</div>
<br>
3. do while Loop:-
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.
<br>
Syntax:
<div style="color: green;">
do {
    <br>
    // Code to be executed
    <br>
} while (condition);
</div>
Example:
<br>
<div style="color: green;">
let i = 0;
<br>
do {
    <br>
    console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
    <br>
    i++;
    <br>
} while (i < 5);

            </h4>

            <h4 style="color: blue;">
                Explaination:- <br>
               1. Variable Declarations:


<li>const num1 = 10;: Declares a constant variable num1 and assigns it the value 10. This variable cannot be reassigned. </li>
<li>const num2 = 25;: Declares a constant variable num2 and assigns it the value 25. </li>
<li>let i;: Declares a variable i using let, which allows it to be reassigned later in the code.  </li>
2. For Loop:

<li>for (i = num1 + 1; i <= num2; i++) { ... }: </li>
<li>Initialization (i = num1 + 1):
The loop starts by initializing the variable i to num1 + 1, which is 11. </li>
<li>Condition (i <= num2):
The loop continues to run as long as i is less than or equal to num2, which is 25. </li>
<li>Iteration (i++):
After each iteration of the loop, the value of i is incremented by 1 (i++). </li>
3.Loop Body:

<li>console.log(i);:
During each iteration of the loop, the current value of i is printed to the console using console.log(i). </li>

            <h4 style="color: blue;">
                Explaination:- 
                <br>
                1. First Loop:-
<li>
Starts at 1 (since number1 + 1 is 1) and prints numbers up to 25 (number2). </li>
<li>It increments j by 1 in each iteration, so it prints 1, 2, 3, ..., 25. </li>
2. Second Loop:-
<li>
Starts at 25 and prints numbers down to 1. </li>
<li>It decrements j by 1 in each iteration, so it prints 25, 24, 23, ..., 1. </li>
